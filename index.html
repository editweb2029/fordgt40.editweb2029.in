                The Ford GT40 is a high-performance endurance racing car commissioned by the Ford Motor Company. It grew out of the "Ford GT" (for Grand Touring) project, an effort to compete in European long-distance sports car races against Ferrari, which won every 24 Hours of Le Mans race from 1960 to 1965.
